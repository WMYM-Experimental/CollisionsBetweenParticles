# Collisions

I wanted to do some things like this a big time ago
It is a collitions simulation with particles (balls, cicles)

## ONE DIMENSIONAL NEWTONIAN

I use that concept and also some code from internet, credit to all.

## Part of my "serie" of simple simulations and animations

Totally free of libraries. Just some _JS, CSS, HTML_ and canvaaas.
